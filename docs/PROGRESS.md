## P0-T1 Repository and package skeleton

Implemented the Git repository metadata, SwiftPM package graph, license, version, README, and compiling skeletons for
all production and test targets.

`swift build 2>&1 | tail -3` (exit 0):

```text
Building for debugging...
[0/5] Write swift-version--1AB21518FC5DEDBE.txt
Build complete! (0.16s)
```

`swift test 2>&1 | tail -3` (exit 0):

```text
Building for debugging...
[0/6] Write swift-version--1AB21518FC5DEDBE.txt
Build complete! (0.17s)
```

Environment note: this Command Line Tools installation ships `Testing.framework` under
`/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Library/Developer/Frameworks`, but SwiftPM does not add that framework search
path to test targets automatically. `Package.swift` adds the Command Line Tools framework path to test compilation
and linking. Plain `swift test` builds the test bundle and exits successfully, but currently prints no test-run
summary; this behavior must be revisited as part of P0-T5 identity-test verification.

`git log --oneline | head` after the task commit:
