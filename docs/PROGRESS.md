# MenuBarStats Progress

Verification results and implementation notes are recorded here by task.

## P0-T1 Repository and package skeleton

Implemented the Git repository metadata, SwiftPM package graph, license, version, README, and compiling skeletons for
all production and test targets.

`swift build 2>&1 | tail -3` (exit 0):

```text

```

Environment note: this Command Line Tools installation ships `Testing.framework` under
`/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Library/Developer/Frameworks`, but SwiftPM does not add that framework search
path to test targets automatically. `Package.swift` adds the Command Line Tools framework path to test compilation
and linking. Plain `swift test` builds the test bundle and exits successfully, but currently prints no test-run
summary; this behavior must be revisited as part of P0-T5 identity-test verification.

`git log --oneline | head` after the task commit:

```

## P0-T2 Bundle assembly and Makefile

Implemented the app-bundle plist, release assembly and ad-hoc signing script, and Makefile targets for the standard
build, test, app, run, stop, install, probe, and clean workflows.

`make app && codesign -dv --verbose=2 dist/MenuBarStats.app 2>&1 | grep -E 'Identifier|Signature'` (exit 0):

```text
./Scripts/make-app.sh

Build of product 'MenuBarStatsApp' complete! (0.16s)
/Users/david/MenuBarStats/dist/MenuBarStats.app: replacing existing signature
Identifier=net.brustein.MenuBarStats
Signature=adhoc
TeamIdentifier=not set
```

`plutil -p dist/MenuBarStats.app/Contents/Info.plist` confirmed:

```text
"CFBundleIdentifier" => "net.brustein.MenuBarStats"
"CFBundleShortVersionString" => "0.1.0"
"CFBundleVersion" => "1"
"LSUIElement" => true
```

Additional validation: `sh -n Scripts/make-app.sh` succeeded and `plutil -lint Scripts/Info.plist` reported `OK`.

## P0-T3 Application shell

Implemented the accessory application lifecycle, single-instance guard, permanent registry of all ten status items,
static image-rendered CPU item, Settings and Quit menu, placeholder SwiftUI settings sidebar, and identity self-test.

`make run` built, signed, and launched the app successfully. `pgrep` confirmed one running process:

```text
14217 /Users/david/MenuBarStats/dist/MenuBarStats.app/Contents/MacOS/MenuBarStats
```

Launching a second copy with `open -n` left that same single process running. The second process notified the first to
show Settings and exited.

The debug-level unified log contained one identity line for every permanent status item. Representative lines:

```text
autosaveName=MenuBarStats.CPU window.title=MenuBarStats.CPU AXIdentifier=MenuBarStats.CPU AXLabel=CPU AXTitle=
autosaveName=MenuBarStats.Weather window.title=MenuBarStats.Weather AXIdentifier=MenuBarStats.Weather AXLabel=Weather AXTitle=
autosaveName=MenuBarStats.Combined window.title=MenuBarStats.Combined AXIdentifier=MenuBarStats.Combined AXLabel=Combined AXTitle=
```

All ten lines had a window title and AX identifier equal to the fixed autosave name, the expected static AX label,
and an empty AX title. The app defaults also recorded hidden visibility for all nine non-CPU items.

Pending manual verification:

- Confirm the CPU image and menu are visually correct, Settings opens and closes, and the menu's Quit item works.
- Command-drag the CPU item once, then check for `NSStatusItem Preferred Position MenuBarStats.CPU` in the app defaults.
- With Thaw running, perform the read-only identity check from the plan and confirm exactly one fixed CPU identity.

The attempted automated menu-bar screenshot failed with `could not create image from rect`, so visual verification
requires direct UI review.

## P0-T4 Probe executable and identity probe

Added dependency-free argument parsing plus the `identity` and `version` subcommands. The identity probe uses a
temporary AppKit status item and removes it before exiting.

`swift run mbs-probe identity` (exit 0):

```text
Build of product 'mbs-probe' complete! (0.99s)
autosaveName=MenuBarStats.Probe
window.title=MenuBarStats.Probe
AXIdentifier=MenuBarStats.Probe
AXLabel=Probe
AXTitle=
button.title=
```

Additional check, `swift run mbs-probe version` (exit 0):

```text
Build of product 'mbs-probe' complete! (0.15s)
0.1.0
```

## P0-T5 Unit test for the identity table

Added `IdentityContractTests`, which hard-codes all ten permanent autosave names and compares them in order with
`ModuleID.allCases`.

`swift test --filter IdentityContractTests` (exit 0):

```text

```

Toolchain deviation: the command exits successfully after compiling and linking but does not print a test-execution
summary, including when passed `--enable-swift-testing --disable-xctest`. The Command Line Tools include
`Testing.framework` but no `XCTest` module, and SwiftPM does not visibly invoke the Swift Testing bundle after it is
built. To verify the contract logic actually executes, the same hard-coded comparison was compiled with `swiftc`
against `ModuleID.swift` and run as an ignored temporary executable:

```text
Identity contract check passed for 10 modules
```

The test source remains in the normal SwiftPM test target. Recheck the runner behavior after the next Command Line
Tools update.

## P1-T1 Core engine

Implemented the monitor protocol, continuous and injectable sample clocks, per-monitor scheduler with pause/resume
and 1-to-60-second exponential error backoff, fixed-capacity history ring buffer, downsampling, and main-actor
observable module stores. Added versioned settings, version 0 migration, debounced `UserDefaults` persistence, JSON
import/export primitives, IOKit power-source notifications, and workspace display sleep/wake notifications.

Added focused tests for history wraparound, time filtering, downsampling, scheduler backoff with a fake clock, settings
round-trip, version 0 migration, and immediate settings-store persistence.

`swift test --filter 'History|Scheduler|Settings'` (exit 0):

```

Command Line Tools deviation: importing both Foundation and Testing activates a `Testing` cross-import overlay for
`_Testing_Foundation`, but that framework has no module interface in this installation. Test compilation uses the
compiler's `-disable-cross-import-overlays` option. The previously documented silent Swift Testing runner behavior
remains: the required command compiles and links successfully but prints no execution summary.

## P1-T2 CPU source and monitor

Implemented Mach per-core tick collection with correct buffer deallocation, Apple Silicon performance/efficiency
topology, load averages, uptime, libproc process enumeration, PID/start-time metadata caching, physical footprints,
thread counts, and timebase-corrected process CPU deltas. Added `CPUMonitor`, complete CPU samples, top-process
selection, and the `mbs-probe cpu [--watch]` command.

`swift run mbs-probe cpu` under normal interactive load (exit 0, selected output):

```text
CPU 15.4% (user 9.7%, system 5.7%, nice 0.0%, idle 84.6%)
load averages: 7.41, 5.85, 4.15; uptime: 179742 s
processes: 805; threads: 4765
cores: E0 48.1%, E1 44.4%, E2 33.3%, E3 33.3%, P4 0.0%, P5 0.0%, P6 0.0%, P7 0.0%, P8 0.0%, P9 17.9%, P10 11.1%, P11 14.8%, P12 6.9%, P13 7.1%
```

`swift run mbs-probe cpu --watch` printed fresh CPU, core, load, uptime, process, and thread values once per second.

Controlled-load verification used one `yes` process. `ps` reported:

```text
PID    %CPU      TIME COMM
17403  99.9   0:13.45 yes
```

The probe reported the process at 7.10% of total machine capacity, which is the expected normalized value for one
fully occupied logical CPU on this 14-core machine. Total CPU rose, but the scheduler migrated the process across
performance cores during the sampling interval, so no single per-core counter remained near 100%. This is a
verification-assumption deviation rather than a data-source failure; per-core values remained internally consistent
with the total.

## P1-T3 Memory source and monitor

Implemented Mach `HOST_VM_INFO64` statistics, host page-size and physical-memory queries, Activity Monitor-style
memory categories, memorystatus pressure, swap usage, kernel pressure notifications, top processes by physical
footprint, `MemoryMonitor`, and `mbs-probe memory`.

`swift run mbs-probe memory` (exit 0):

```text
Memory 36.50 GiB used of 48.00 GiB
app 16.65 GiB; wired 5.15 GiB; compressed 14.70 GiB; cached 9.20 GiB; free 11.50 GiB
pressure 43.0% (normal); swap 0.0 MiB of 0.0 MiB
top processes:
    1102  8.64 GiB  prl_vm_app
   93467  6.25 GiB  com.apple.Virtualization.Virtua
    2968  1.50 GiB  iTerm2
```

The independent `memory_pressure` tool reported `System-wide memory free percentage: 57%`, exactly matching the
probe's derived 43% pressure. `sysctl vm.swapusage` independently reported total and used swap of 0.00 MiB, matching
the probe. Direct Activity Monitor visual comparison remains part of manual review.

## P1-T4 Menu bar rendering framework

Implemented the `MenuBarRenderer` protocol, render context and light/dark palette, fixed-width monospaced text,
line/area/bar graphs, stacked labels, SF Symbol plus text, and combined-renderer scaffold. Added generic observable
status-item controllers that only update `button.image` and AXValue, plus a coordinator connecting CPU and Memory
stores, schedulers, power-aware interval multipliers, and display sleep/wake pause and resume.

CPU supports percentage, history graph, per-core bars, stacked label/value, and icon/text modes. Memory supports used
percentage, pressure percentage, history graph, used bar, and stacked label/value modes.

User feedback changed the defaults from ambiguous bare percentages to labeled, two-line iStat-style presentations:
`CPU` and `MEM` above their values. A one-time presentation-default migration updated the settings created by the
earlier Phase 1 launch without touching status-item position preferences. The persisted settings now contain:

```text
"cpu" ... "mode":"stacked"
"memory" ... "mode":"stacked"
```

`make run` built, signed, and launched the live app successfully. Render logs confirmed changing values:

```text
module=Memory value=Memory 79.4 percent used, pressure 56.0 percent
module=CPU value=CPU 37.1 percent
module=CPU value=CPU 28.3 percent
module=Memory value=Memory 80.3 percent used, pressure 53.0 percent
```

Screenshots were captured in `dist/phase1-light.png` and `dist/phase1-dark.png`. Both appearances rendered without
clipping. The required temporary switch to light appearance was visible to the user before the scripted restoration
completed; dark appearance was immediately restored and verified through both global defaults and a new screenshot.
Do not change the user's system appearance again without an explicit warning immediately before the change.

## P1-T5 Dropdown framework

Implemented a reusable `DropdownController` that owns each module menu, hosts a 320-point SwiftUI detail view,
provides Settings and Quit commands, and runs a half-second `.common`-mode timer while menu tracking is active. The
timer advances the observable store revision and logs `tracking tick` records in the `dropdown` category.

The CPU dropdown includes a live history graph with 1-minute, 5-minute, 30-minute, 3-hour, and 24-hour ranges,
per-core activity bars, load averages, uptime, process/thread counts, app icons, top-process CPU values, and process
termination. Processes owned by another user or macOS require an explicit warning confirmation. The Memory dropdown
includes a composition bar and legend, pressure history and severity coloring, swap use, app icons, and top process
footprints. History capacities now retain a full 24 hours at the normal CPU and Memory intervals.

`swift build` (exit 0):

[3/7] Compiling MenuBarStatsUI MonitoringCoordinator.swift
[4/7] Emitting module MenuBarStatsUI
[8/10] Linking MenuBarStatsApp
Build complete! (1.42s)
```

`make app` and `make run` both exited 0. The packaged process remained running from
`dist/MenuBarStats.app/Contents/MacOS/MenuBarStats`, confirming startup and menu installation did not crash.

The required interactive 10-second open-menu check and corresponding live `log stream` capture remain for David's
review because they require holding the actual CPU menu open. If the graph does not advance during that check, P1-T5
must be reopened to add the `NSPanel` fallback before Phase 1 is accepted.

## P1-T6 Settings panes for General, CPU, and Memory

Replaced the placeholder settings window with working General, CPU, and Memory panes. General settings now control
launch at login through `SMAppService`, reduced sampling on battery, monochrome rendering, font size, and JSON import
and export. CPU and Memory settings now provide enabled toggles, labeled display-mode choices, a renderer-backed live
preview image, fixed-width digits, graph style, separate light/dark colors, live sampling intervals, process-list
visibility, and a configurable 1-to-10 row count.

Sampling interval changes now flow from the persisted module settings into each scheduler. Dropdown process controls
are live, and both monitors retain enough candidates to honor the 10-row maximum.

`swift build` (exit 0):

```

The first build exposed a Swift 6.2.3 compiler crash while emitting a `Binding<Bool>` whose setter directly
referenced the main-actor login-service method. Replacing that one control with an equivalent state-labeled
Enable/Disable button avoided the compiler defect without relaxing concurrency checks.

`make app`, `make run`, and a second `open -n dist/MenuBarStats.app` all exited 0. The second launch opened the
settings handoff and terminated, leaving exactly one owner process:

```text
20031 /Users/david/MenuBarStats/dist/MenuBarStats.app/Contents/MacOS/MenuBarStats
```

`swift test --filter Settings` exited 0 after compiling and linking the test bundle; the previously documented silent
Swift Testing runner behavior remains. The interactive CPU hide/show check against Thaw remains for David's review;
Thaw was not launched or modified, as required by the repository rules.
