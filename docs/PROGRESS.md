# MenuBarStats Progress

Verification results and implementation notes are recorded here by task.

## P0-T1 Repository and package skeleton

Implemented the Git repository metadata, SwiftPM package graph, license, version, README, and compiling skeletons for
all production and test targets.

`swift build 2>&1 | tail -3` (exit 0):

```text
Building for debugging...
[0/5] Write swift-version--1AB21518FC5DEDBE.txt
Build complete! (0.16s)
```

`swift test 2>&1 | tail -3` (exit 0):

```text
Building for debugging...
[0/6] Write swift-version--1AB21518FC5DEDBE.txt
Build complete! (0.17s)
```

Environment note: this Command Line Tools installation ships `Testing.framework` under
`/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Library/Developer/Frameworks`, but SwiftPM does not add that framework search
path to test targets automatically. `Package.swift` adds the Command Line Tools framework path to test compilation
and linking. Plain `swift test` builds the test bundle and exits successfully, but currently prints no test-run
summary; this behavior must be revisited as part of P0-T5 identity-test verification.

`git log --oneline | head` after the task commit:

```text
1b5bf58 P0-T1: repository and package skeleton
```

## P0-T2 Bundle assembly and Makefile

Implemented the app-bundle plist, release assembly and ad-hoc signing script, and Makefile targets for the standard
build, test, app, run, stop, install, probe, and clean workflows.

`make app && codesign -dv --verbose=2 dist/MenuBarStats.app 2>&1 | grep -E 'Identifier|Signature'` (exit 0):

```text
./Scripts/make-app.sh
[0/1] Planning build
Building for production...
[0/2] Write swift-version--1AB21518FC5DEDBE.txt
Build of product 'MenuBarStatsApp' complete! (0.16s)
/Users/david/MenuBarStats/dist/MenuBarStats.app: replacing existing signature
Identifier=net.brustein.MenuBarStats
Signature=adhoc
TeamIdentifier=not set
```

`plutil -p dist/MenuBarStats.app/Contents/Info.plist` confirmed:

```text
"CFBundleIdentifier" => "net.brustein.MenuBarStats"
"CFBundleShortVersionString" => "0.1.0"
"CFBundleVersion" => "1"
"LSUIElement" => true
```

Additional validation: `sh -n Scripts/make-app.sh` succeeded and `plutil -lint Scripts/Info.plist` reported `OK`.
